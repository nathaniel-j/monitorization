# monitorization
This notebook is an exploritory data analysis looking into computer monitor features and pricing for the purpose of purchasing a new monitor. It is currently a work in progress. I will be scraping data from the web and compiling it into a Pandas DataFrame. Once this data is inside a dataframe, I will have to clean and transform the columns into a useable format for data analysis. Depending on the features that I am able to collect, I plan to run regression analysis across several features to try to determine the price value of different features, as well as build a linear regression model for price prediction and then use this regression line to help identify models that have the best value for the price.
